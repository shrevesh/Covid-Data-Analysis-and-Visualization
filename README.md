# Covid-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
Analysis of Covid Infection Cases, Deaths and Vaccination during 2020-2023 Data downloaded from Our world in data included more than 20 columns including number of new cases, new deaths, new vaccination, people in different age and different diseases... There are 296,961 rows, each row represents for updates in cases reported by date. The date starts from 1/20/2020 to the current date of this analysis, 3/21/2023. For the purpose of this analysis, I only used a few of these meaningful columns to understand the changes of cases and deaths recorded over time across the world. I used Microsoft SQL Server to import the data, and analyze the data.

There are a few questions I tried to answer from this analysis

1. How infection is Coronavirus?
2. Which countries are impacted heavily because of Covid?
3. Are there differences in the death rate of Covid in different countries?
4. How efficient is the vaccination campaign in different countries?
5. Death rate of corona virus compared to other historical pandemics.
